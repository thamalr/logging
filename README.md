Logging in Python is a built-in module that provides a way to log events and messages in a running program. It allows developers to record and store information about a program's behavior during runtime, which can be used for debugging, performance monitoring, and auditing purposes. The logging module provides functions and classes that enable developers to create loggers, handlers, filters, and formatters to customize the logging output based on their specific needs. By using the logging module, developers can capture valuable information about their programs' activities, such as error messages, warning messages, debug messages, and other types of events, and save them to a file, display them on the console, or send them to a remote server for analysis.
